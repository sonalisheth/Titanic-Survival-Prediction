# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
I'm Super excited to start my Data Science Journey with the famous Titanic Dataset! 
This is my first Data Science Project !!





It is one of the most popular datasets used for understanding machine learning basics.
It contains information of all the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which unfortunately was shipwrecked. 
This dataset can be used to predict whether a given passenger survived or not.
